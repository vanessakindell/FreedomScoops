// TODO: Older news
// This was once called Freedom Flakes but it was changed into Freedom Scoops 
// due to not being related to a Flake. Lot stuff added and changed. 
// Most of the time was spent fixing repo due braking the source code as it got uploaded, 
// Non-stop repo problems give me some pain. Hopefully it gets fixed. 
// I might try SSH see what happens if does the trck it will be noted 
// for everyone so they won't face problems what I did for those last hard few months.
