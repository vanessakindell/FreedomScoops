This directory contains the palette generation script. The output of the
script is the PLAYPAL lump.

The Doom engine operates in a palettized screen mode where only 256
different colors can be shown on screen at a given time. By applying
alternate palettes, special effects can be generated (eg. the red tint
when taking damage, or the green tint when wearing the radsuit). More
information can be found on the Doom wiki:

    <http://doomwiki.org/wiki/PLAYPAL>

The input for the script is playpal-base.lmp which contains the default
palette seen during normal gameplay. The script translates this palette
into the various other forms which are shown in different situations.

There is additionally a “gen-gimp-palette” script that may be used to
create a “doom.gpl” file suitable for importing into GIMP’s palette
selection.
