This directory contains the generator script for the COLORMAP lump. The
COLORMAP lump is used to calculate Doom's lighting; it translates normal
colors into darkened versions in 32 different levels of light. Some more
details can be found on the Doom wiki:

Boom extends the COLORMAP to allow the addition of extra colormap lumps;
these can be used to apply colored lighting and other effects.
