This directory contains the source DeHackEd patch used for Freedoom.

We generate three unique files for each IWAD, most of the data being
identical to each other.

- FreeDM has all par times set to 0 and the map names would otherwise
  override Phase 2.
- We override the no-clipping cheat in Phase 1 so IDCLIP is used in
  all games.
- Phase 2 has map names that would otherwise override FreeDM.
