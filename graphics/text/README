This is a script that generates the big font graphics used in the menus and
intermission screens. The font used to generate the graphics is in the
subdirectory 'fontchars'. This is based on the original font graphics
(found in 'font') which have been split up into individual files each
containing a single character.

The script generates the images by use of Pillow to composite
character graphics together.
