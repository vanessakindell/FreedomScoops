This directory contains the in-game sound effects. There are two types
of sound effect found here:

 * ds*.wav files are digital (PCM) sound effects, the sound effects
   usually heard when playing the game.

 * dp*.txt files are PC speaker sound effects, heard when playing with a
   source port that support PC speaker effects and configured to do so.

Because of the limitations of deutex it is important that sound effects
should be in 8-bit PCM format and not anything more elaborate. Some more
information about Doom's sound effect support can be found on the Doom
wiki:
