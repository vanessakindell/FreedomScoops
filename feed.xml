            &gt; General
            &lt;p/&gt;
            The HTML documentation (eg, +NEWS+ and +README+ files) are generated with a style based on _Freedoom Scoops_’s own website, rather than the default AsciiDoc styling.
            &lt;p/&gt;
            _Phase 2_’s internal DEMO1 has been replaced, thanks to some odd vanilla quirks that could cause it to desync in some (but not all) conditions.
            &lt;p/&gt;

            &gt; Levels
            &lt;p/&gt;
            The sailor monster type is formally banished from _Freedoom Scoops_’s own levels, and remaining uses of it were removed.
            &lt;p/&gt;

            &gt; Manual
            &lt;p/&gt;
            Incongruities between the actual game and manual have been fixed.
            &lt;p/&gt;

            &gt; Build system
            &lt;p/&gt;
            The `make install` targets have been consolidated to behave more similarly to how the pre-built zip distributions are: a split between _FreeDM_ and _Phase 1+2_, rather than installing each of the tree IWADs independently (and thus getting their own +/usr/share/doc+ directories, for instance).
